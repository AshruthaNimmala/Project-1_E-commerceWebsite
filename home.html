      <h2>Welcome to Guardian Ride for SHE</h2>
      <p>
        We provide several services for women such as New Government schemes
        especially focusing on woman safety and help line numbers. You can
        access informative guides and tutorials. Your safety and comfort are our
        top priorities.

        Today, many women suffer from domestic violence and are afraid to talk
        about it. According to international studies, this problem will be
        confronted not only in India, but also in many countries of Europe,
        America, and Canada. We offer this application that includes
        step-by-step instructions on how to act if you have been victimized by
        violence and several other features.

        You can send us suggestions, tokens of appreciation, or criticism using
